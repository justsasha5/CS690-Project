A Day in the Life of Emily

Morning

Emily wakes up feeling a bit off—a dull headache and some lingering fatigue from the day before. She shrugs it off as stress and moves on with her morning routine. As she’s getting dressed, she remembers her doctor asking last month about how often she’s been getting headaches.

Emily thinks, “If I’d kept track of these things, I might have had an answer.” But the thought fades as she rushes out the door. 

Late Morning

At work, Emily has another headache. She grabs some painkillers from her bag and wonders if she’s been taking them too often. How many did she take last week? She tries to remember but quickly gives up.

Her coworker Sarah shares that she’s been tracking her migraines in a journal. “It helps me spot patterns,” Sarah says. Emily nods, thinking it’s a good idea, but she doesn’t want to carry around a notebook everywhere.

Lunch

Over lunch, Emily browses an article about managing chronic symptoms. It mentions keeping a record of when symptoms occur, their severity, and possible triggers. “That sounds helpful,” she thinks, but the idea of jotting everything down feels tedious.

She makes a mental note to try something simple, like recording just the date and severity of her headaches—but then gets distracted by an email from her boss.

Afternoon

Emily’s doctor texts her a reminder for her upcoming appointment. “Don’t forget to bring notes on any new symptoms,” the message says.

Emily stares at the message, realizing she has no notes to bring. She tries to remember her last headache before today, but everything blurs together. “How am I supposed to remember all this?” she mutters. 

Evening

Back home, Emily feels frustrated about her lack of organization. Her symptoms come and go, and she’s always too busy to keep track. “There has to be a simpler way to handle this,” she thinks, but the thought drifts away as she prepares dinner.
